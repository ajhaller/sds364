\caption{The Moderated Mediation Model: This figure shows the associations between predictors, mediators, and response variables as the moderated mediation model. Model 1 is represented by green arrows, and model 2 is represented by blue arrows. Dashed arrows are statistically insignificant coefficients (B) demonstrating p values \textgreater{} 0.05. Bold arrows and asterix are statistically significant coefficients (B) with p values \textless{} 0.05.}
