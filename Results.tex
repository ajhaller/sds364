\subsection{Relationship Satisfaction and Partner Objectifcation}\label{relationship-satisfaction-and-partner-objectifcation}}

Figure 1 shows the direct association between predictors other objectification of a man and the woman's other objectification, and woman's relationship satisfaction and the relationship satisfaction of the man as the response variable. Figure 1 shows there were no significant associations between a man's objectification of his partner with the woman's relationship satisfaction in romantic relationships (b = 0.011, p = 0.846), and between the woman's objectification of her partner with the man's relationship satisfaction in romantic relationship (b = 0.002, p = 0.967) (see Figure 1.). Hypothesis 1 is not supported as the results show there is not a statistically significant relationship between other objectification and relationship satisfaction for both men and women. Hypothesis 2 is not supported as the results show there are not statistically significant differences in other objectification and relationship satisfaction between gender. Please refer to table 1 for supplemental information.

\subsection{Relationship Satisfaction with Mediation}\label{relationship-satisfaction-with-mediation}}

Models 1 and 2 includes the variable self objectification for both the man and the woman as a mediator between the other objectification of a man with the woman's relationship satisfaction (model 1), and the associations between other objectification of a woman with the man's relationship satisfaction (model 2).

In Model 1, there is not a significant association between the man's partner objectification towards the woman with the woman's relationship satisfaction while mediating for the woman's objectification of herself (b = 0.039, p = 0.519)(see Figure 1.). This does not support our third hypothesis which suggested that the association between man's objectification of his partner and the partner's relationship satisfaction is dependent on a woman's objectification of herself. However, model 1 did result in a statistically significant association between the man's partner objectification and the woman's self objectification (b = 0.279, p = 0.0002)(see Figure 1.). This suggests that a man who objectifies the woman in a heterosexual relationship is associated with the woman objectifying herself more.

Model 2 shows that there is no significant association between a woman's objectification of her partner and the partner's relationship satisfaction with the man's self objectification as a mediating variable (b = 0.026, p = 0.687)( see Figure 1.). This does not support our fourth hypothesis that the association between a woman's objectification of her partner and the partner's relationship satisfaction is dependent on a man's objectification of himself. However, Model 2 also shows that there is a statistically significant indirect relationship between the woman's partner objectification and the man's self objectification (b = 0.209, p = 0.011). This suggests that a woman's partner objectification towards the man makes men in heterosexual relationships objectify themselves more. Results in model 2 also show that a man's objectification of himself is associated with a decrease in his relationship satisfaction (b = -0.150, p = 0.015)(see Figure 1.).
